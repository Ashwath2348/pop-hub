    <h1>Computer Generations</h1>
    
    <h2>1964 – 1971: Third Generation – Integrated Circuits</h2>
    <p>By this phase, transistors were now being miniaturised and put on silicon chips (called semiconductors). This led to a massive increase in speed and efficiency of these machines. These were the first computers where users interacted using keyboards and monitors which interfaced with an operating system, a significant leap up from the punch cards and printouts. This enabled these machines to run several applications at once using a central program which functioned to monitor memory.</p>
    <p>As a result of these advances which again made machines cheaper and smaller, a new mass market of users emerged during the ‘60s. This generation of computers also had an operating system which is a special program meant to control the resources of the computer. By virtue of a feature known as time sharing, the computer could run programs invoked by multiple users. The existing programming languages were supplemented by BASIC, C, C++ and Java.</p>
    
    <h2>1972 – 2010: Fourth Generation – Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>This revolution can be summed in one word: Intel. The chip-maker developed the Intel 4004 chip in 1971, which positioned all computer components (CPU, memory, input/output controls) onto a single chip. What filled a room in the 1940s now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel chip housed thousands of integrated circuits. The year 1981 saw the first ever computer (IBM) specifically designed for home use and 1984 saw the MacIntosh introduced by Apple.</p>
    <p>Microprocessors even moved beyond the realm of computers and into an increasing number of everyday products. The increased power of these small computers meant they could be linked, creating networks, which ultimately led to the development, birth and rapid evolution of the Internet. Other major advances during this period have been the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the mouse, and more recently the astounding advances in laptop capability and hand-held devices.</p>
    
    <h2>2010- : Fifth Generation – Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Computer devices with artificial intelligence are still in development, but some of these technologies are beginning to emerge and be used, such as voice recognition. AI is a reality made possible by using parallel processing and superconductors. Looking to the future, computers will be radically transformed again by quantum computation, molecular and nanotechnology.</p>
    <p>The essence of the fifth generation will be using these technologies to ultimately create machines which can process and respond to natural language, and have the capability to learn and organise themselves.</p>
    
    <h2>Computer Types</h2>
    
    <h3>Super Computer</h3>
    <p>These are huge machines having the most powerful and fast processors. A supercomputer has multiple CPUs for parallel data processing. Speed is measured in terms of flops (floating point operations per second). Supercomputers are too powerful to be used for transaction processing. They are mainly used in areas like weather forecasting, analysis of geological data, nuclear simulation, and space exploration. They are also used to solve complex scientific problems. Supercomputers have enormous storage, use huge amounts of power, and generate a lot of heat. Because of the exorbitant cost, they are mainly used by government agencies.</p>
    
    <h3>Mainframes</h3>
    <p>A mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. A mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports the simultaneous execution of multiple programs. Mainframes are used to handle data and applications related to the organisation as a whole. Today, mainframes are employed to handle online transactions. The capability to handle large amounts of data makes the mainframe suitable for use in government, banks and financial institutions, and large corporations.</p>
    
    <h3>Minicomputers</h3>
    <p>A computer that is smaller, less expensive, and less powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer but more expensive and more powerful than a personal computer. Minicomputers are used for scientific and engineering computations, business-transaction processing, file handling, and database management, and are often now referred to as small or midsize servers.</p>
    
    <h3>Microcomputers</h3>
    <p>An electronic device with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). A microcomputer was formerly a commonly used term for a personal computer, particularly any of a class of small digital computers whose CPU is contained on a single integrated semiconductor chip. Thus, a microcomputer uses a single microprocessor for its CPU, which performs all logic and arithmetic operations. The system also contains a number of associated semiconductor chips that serve as the main memory for storing program instructions and data and as interfaces for exchanging data of this sort with peripheral equipment—namely, input/output devices (e.g., keyboard, video display, and printer) and auxiliary storage units. Smaller microcomputers first marketed in the 1970s contain a single chip on which all CPU, memory, and interface circuits are integrated. They are mainly used for engineering and scientific applications and for software development, along with word processing, desktop publishing, internet browsing, and handling audio, video, and image files.</p>
    
    <h3>Smartphones and Embedded Computers</h3>
    <p>Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software, and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).</p>
    <p>Embedded computers are everywhere. They are in phones, microwaves, airplanes, automobiles, calculators... The list goes on and on. An embedded computer, which is an integral component of most embedded systems, is a combination of hardware and software that is designed to perform a highly specific function. Because the software in embedded computers is designed to only execute certain tasks, the computer’s software in one device can be totally distinct from that of another. The hardware of an embedded computer is also specially designed to withstand stresses in its intended environment.</p>
