        <h2>1. Introduction to Structures in C</h2>
        <h3>The Need for Structures</h3>
        <p>Variables sometimes influence each otherâ€™s values. A change in one may necessitate a corresponding change in another. Structures help group related variables together to manage this situation more effectively.</p>
        <pre>
        int d, m, y;  // day, month, year
        </pre>
        <p>Although these variables represent a single concept (a date), there is no mechanism to group them together in C. Consider a function <code>next_day()</code> to calculate the next day:</p>
        <pre>
        void next_day(int *, int *, int *);
        </pre>
        <p>Without structures, passing these variables together in a group is difficult, which might lead to incorrect data being passed to the function. Structures solve this problem by grouping these variables together.</p>

        <h3>Why Does C Enable Us to Create Structures?</h3>
        <p>C allows creating user-defined types (structures) to group variables together under a single name. This enhances data organization and safety.</p>
        <pre>
        struct date {
            int d, m, y;
        };
        </pre>
        <p>Now, a function like <code>next_day()</code> can take the address of the structure directly, avoiding mistakes in passing unrelated variables.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>C structures can't contain functions, only data members.</li>
            <li>Data is not secure and can be modified by any function.</li>
            <li>Associated functions are not part of the structure itself, making it difficult to maintain integrity in larger applications.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Issues of Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) and Data Security</h2>
        <h3>Issues of Procedure-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> In POP, data is not protected from modification by external functions. Functions and data are separate, so any function can access and modify global data.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessing Data:</strong> Functions can share global data, leading to data being passed around freely and risking unintentional modifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Control:</strong> There's no strict mechanism to control access to data, which makes it difficult to ensure that data remains consistent and secure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Object-Oriented Programming Solves Data Security Issues</h3>
        <p>OOP solves this problem with the concept of data encapsulation. Data is hidden and can only be accessed through specific methods inside the object. The class controls access to its data, ensuring only authorized modifications.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>3. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</h2>
        <p>OOP is a programming paradigm that models real-world problems using objects. Objects are instances of classes and contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods). OOP helps organize code better and enhances reuse and modularity.</p>

        <h3>Salient Features of OOP and POP Comparison</h3>
        <p><strong>Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on functions and procedures.</li>
            <li>Programs are divided into functions that manipulate global data.</li>
            <li>Follows a <em>Top-Down</em> approach in program design.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Programs are divided into objects that contain both data and methods.</li>
            <li>Follows a <em>Bottom-Up</em> approach in program design.</li>

        <h2>5. Characteristics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>

        <h3>i) Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>Encapsulation combines data and functions into a single unit called a class. Data is hidden and can only be accessed through public methods.</p>

        <h3>ii) Polymorphism</h3>
        <p>Polymorphism allows one function to behave differently based on the object calling it. This can include function overloading or operator overloading.</p>

        <h3>iii) Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, enabling reusability of code.</p>
