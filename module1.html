    <h1>Generations of Computers</h1>
    
    <h2>1940 – 1956: First Generation – Vacuum Tubes</h2>
    <p>These early computers used vacuum tubes as circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. They were enormous, consumed a lot of electricity, and generated significant heat. Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, with output via print-outs. Notable machines include UNIVAC and ENIAC.</p>
    
    <h2>1956 – 1963: Second Generation – Transistors</h2>
    <p>The use of transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more efficient. High-level programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN were introduced. Computers began storing instructions in memory and were used in the atomic energy industry.</p>
    
    <h2>1964 – 1971: Third Generation – Integrated Circuits</h2>
    <p>Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, significantly improving speed and efficiency. Users interacted with computers using keyboards and monitors with an operating system. Time-sharing allowed multiple users to run programs simultaneously. Languages such as BASIC, C, C++, and Java emerged.</p>
    
    <h2>1972 – 2010: Fourth Generation – Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>Microprocessors, pioneered by Intel's 4004 chip, integrated all computer components onto a single chip. Personal computers became widespread with IBM's first home computer (1981) and Apple's Macintosh (1984). The rise of networking and the Internet marked this era, alongside GUI, the mouse, and mobile devices.</p>
    
    <h2>2010 – Present: Fifth Generation – Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>AI-powered computers are under development, with advancements in voice recognition, parallel processing, and superconductors. Future trends include quantum computing, molecular technology, and self-learning systems capable of natural language processing.</p>
