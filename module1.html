1. Which programming needs do structures fulfill? Why does C language enable us to create structures? What are the
limitations of structures?
The Need for Structures
Variables sometimes influence each other’s values. A change in the value of one may necessitate a corresponding adjustment in the
value of another. It is, therefore, necessary to pass these variables together in a single group to functions. Structures enable us to do
this. Take the example of date. A date can be represented in C by three different integer variables taken together.
int d,m,y; //Here d, m, and y represent the day of the month, the month, and the year, respectively.
Although these three variables are not grouped together in the code, they actually belong to the same group. The value of one variable
may influence the value of the other two. In order to understand this clearly, consider a function next_day() that accepts the addresses
of the three integers that represent a date and changes their values to represent the next day.
void next_day(int *,int *,int *); //function to calculate the next day
If d=31;m=12; y=1999; //31st December, 1999 and we call the function as next_day(&d,&m,&y); ‘d’ will become 1, ‘m’ will
become 1, and ‘y’ will become 2000. A change in the value of one may change the value of the other two. But there is no language
construct that actually places them in the same group. Thus, members of the wrong group may be accidentally sent to the function as
given below:
d1=28; m1=2; y1=1999; //28th February, 1999
d2=19; m2=3; y2=1999; //19th March, 1999
next_day(&d1,&m1,&y1); //OK
next_day(&d1,&m2,&y2); //What? Incorrect set passed!
There is nothing in the language itself that prevents the wrong set of variables from being sent to the function. Moreover, integer-type
variables that are not meant to represent dates might also be sent to the function. The solution to this problem is to create a data type
called date itself using structures.
Why does C language enable us to create structures?
Structure is a programming construct in C that allows us to put together variables that should be together.
Library programmers use structures to create new data types. Application programs and other library programs use these new data
types by declaring variables of this data type. A struct in C is a complex data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of
variables to be placed under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single variable or
pointer. The struct can contain many other complex and simple data types in an association, so is a natural organizing type for records
like the mixed data types. For example
struct date { //a structure to represent dates
int d, m, y;
};
Now, the next_day() function will accept the address of a variable of the structure date as a parameter. Accordingly, its prototype will
be as follows:
void next_day(struct date *);
struct date d1;
d1.d=28;
d1.m=2;
d1.y=1999;
next_day(&d1);
‘d1.d’, ‘d1.m’, and ‘d1.y’ will be correctly set to 1, 3, and 1999, respectively. Since the function takes the address of an entire
structure variable as a parameter at a time, there is no chance of variables of the different groups being sent to the function.
Limitations of Structures
• In C structure can't contain functions means only data members are allowed
• Associated functions that were designed by library programmer don’t have rights to work upon the data stored in structures.
• They are not a part of structure definition itself because application program might modify the structure variables by some
code inadvertently written in application program itself While distributing his/her application, application programmer can’t
be sure that program would run successfully.
• Data stored in structures is not secure and can be manipulated by any function/procedure. Therefore every new piece of code
accessing structure variable will have to be inspected and tested again to ensure that it doesn’t corrupt the members of
structure.

programming solves it then how?
3. What is object oriented programming? Bring out the salient features of procedure oriented programming and object
oriented programming. OR State important features of object oriented programming. Compare object oriented system with
procedure oriented systems.
4. List out the difference between procedure oriented and object oriented techniques. OR Compare/Differentiate between
procedure oriented and object oriented programming systems.
5. Explain the various characteristics /features of object oriented programming (OOP). OR Describe the following
characteristics/features of object oriented programming: i) Encapsulation ii) Polymorphism iii) Inheritance
Procedure oriented programming: In the procedure oriented approach, the problem is viewed as a sequence of things to be done
such as reading, calculating and printing. The focus of procedure oriented programming is to break down a programming task into a
collection of functions, variables and data structures. The primary focus is on functions. A number of functions are written to
accomplish these tasks. Conventional programming using high level languages such as FORTRAN and C, is commonly known as
procedure oriented programming (POP).
Characteristics/Features of Procedure Oriented Programming System
• Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions
• Focus is on functions.
• Functions can share global data
• Data can move freely around the system from one function to other function. Data (contained in structure variables) is passed
from one function to another to be read from or written into.
• Functions are associated with the data but they are not a part of it. Instead they receive structure variables / their addresses and
work upon them.
• Employs top-down approach in program design.
Issues/Disadvantages of Procedure Oriented Programming System
• Data is not secure and can be manipulated by any function/procedure.
• Associated functions that were designed by library programmer don’t have exclusive rights to work upon the data.
• They are not a part of structure definition itself because application program might modify the structure variables by some code
inadvertently written in application program itself.
• While distributing the application, application programmer can’t be sure that program would run successfully.
• Every new piece of code accessing structure variable will have to be inspected and tested again to ensure that it doesn’t corrupt
the members of structure.
• Compilers that implement procedure oriented programming systems don’t prevent unauthorized functions from accessing /
manipulating the structure variables. Lack of data security of procedure oriented programs has led to Object Oriented
Programming Systems
How does object oriented programming solves the problem of data security?
In order to solve the problem of data security, one of the most important feature provided by the object oriented systems is “data hiding”
facility. OOP gives lots of importance to data. Programmer can hide the really important core data from external world using OOP
method. A class is a feature in OOP which facilitates to pack together different data types along with different functions that manipulate
these data members of class. Data members can be declared as private or public inside a class. To hide the data from external world, a
programmer does it by declaring the data as private. Class allows to pack together data with its associated functions. In OOP we use
another entity named ‘object’ to access both data and functions inside a class. We call data or function inside a class as ‘class
member‘. A class member can be accessed from external world (outside the class) using an object of the class only!. This feature of
data hiding is called as “Data Encapsulation“. Thus one of the major flaws of POP is solved in OOP. OOP ties the data closely to a
particular class and its objects. There is no need of “global data types” as in POP and hence data will not flow freely around the
program. This makes sure there will be no ‘accidental modification’ of critical data.
Object oriented programming: OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number entities called objects and then builds data and
functions around these objects. The data of an object can be accessed only by the functions associated with that object. However,
functions of one object can access the functions of other objects. Object oriented programming breaks down a programming task into
objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (members or attributes) using interfaces.

Characteristics of Object Oriented Programming System
• Emphasis is on data rather than procedures or functions.
• Programs are divided into what are known as objects.
• Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.
• Functions that operate on the data are tied together in the data structure.
• Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions.
• Objects may communicate with each other through functions.
• New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.
• Follows bottom-up approach in program design.
Important features/concepts of OOPS
• Object: Object is a collection of attributes/entities. Objects take up space in the memory. Objects are instances of classes. When a
program is executed, the objects interact by sending messages to one another. Each object contain data and code to manipulate the
data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code.
• Class: Class is a collection of objects of similar type. Objects are variables of the type class. Once a class has been defined, we can
create any number of objects belonging to that class. Eg: grapes bananas and orange are the member of class fruit. Example:
Fruit orange; // Here object orange is an instance of class fruit.
• Encapsulation: Combining data and functions into a single unit called class and the process is known as Encapsulation. Data
encapsulation is important feature of a class. Class contains both data and functions. Data is not accessible from the outside world
and only those function which are present in the class can access the data.
• Data Hiding and Abstraction: The insulation of the data from direct access by the program is called data hiding. Hiding the
complexity of program is called Abstraction and only essential features are represented. In short we can say that internal working
is hidden.
• Inheritance: it is the process by which object of one class acquire the properties or features of objects of another class. The concept
of inheritance provide the idea of reusability means we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it. This
is possible by driving a new class from the existing one. The new class will have the combined features of both the classes
Example: Sparrow is a part of the class flying bird which is again a part of the class bird.
• Polymorphism: A Greek term means ability to take more than one form. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in
different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation. Examples
- Function overloading & Operator Overloading
- Static & Dynamic Polymorphism
• Message Passing: The process by which one object can interact with other object is called message passing.
• Dynamic Binding: Refers to linking of function call with function definition is called binding and when it is take place at run
time called dynamic binding.
Difference between Procedure Oriented Programming (POP) & Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Procedure Oriented Programming (POP) Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Divided Into In POP, program is divided into small parts
called functions.
In OOP, program is divided into parts called objects.
Importance In POP, Importance is not given to data but to
functions as well as sequence of actions to be
done.
In OOP, Importance is given to the data rather than
procedures or functions because it works as a real world.
Approach POP follows Top Down approach. OOP follows Bottom Up approach.
Access
Specifiers
POP does not have any access specifier. OOP has access specifiers named Public, Private, Protected,
etc.
Data Moving In POP, Data can move freely from function to
function in the system.
In OOP, objects can move and communicate with each
other through member functions.
Expansion To add new data and function in POP is not so
easy.
OOP provides an easy way to add new data and function.
Data Access In POP, Most function uses Global data for
sharing that can be accessed freely from function
to function in the system.
In OOP, data cannot move easily from function to function,
it can be kept public or private so we can control the access
of data.
Data Hiding POP does not have any proper way for hiding
data so it is less secure.
OOP provides Data Hiding so provides more security.
Overloading In POP, Overloading is not possible. In OOP, overloading is possible in the form of Function
Overloading and Operator Overloading.
Examples Example of POP are: C, VB, FORTRAN, Pascal. Example of OOP are: C++, JAVA, VB.NET, C#.NET
